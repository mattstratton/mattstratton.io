One of my "must have" utilities on OS X is Alfred. Sure, Spotlight is rad and everything, but the high level of customization that Alfred provides me is deeply ingrained into my muscle memory. This is just a list of a few of the Alfred Workflows that I love, and highly recommend.

* [Toggle Wifi](http://www.packal.org/workflow/toggle-wifi) - When my computer is in my home office, the wifi is abysmal. I like to flip it off to only use Ethernet there; this simple workflow lets me switch wifi on and off.
* [Speedtest](http://www.packal.org/workflow/speedtest) - Like I said, my internet speed can be flaky. This performs a quick speedtest. Yes, I could run `speedtest-cli` in the terminal, but whatever.
* [Alfred Chrome](http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-chrome) - I use several Google Chrome profiles; and it never fails that the one I am trying to open the link in is the one with the wrong user. In theory this will pop a URL in the profile that I want. I'm having some issues with it now, but the idea is sound.
* [CoffeeCoffee](http://www.packal.org/workflow/coffeecoffee) - Keep your Mac from sleeping
* [Slackfred](http://www.packal.org/workflow/slackfred) - Adds Slack functions to Alfred
* [Resize Image](http://www.packal.org/workflow/resize-image) - Resize an image, selected in Finder, to a target width
* [Packal Updater](http://www.packal.org/workflow/packal-updater) - Update all your Alfred workflows (if they are hosted on Packal)
* [GitHub](http://www.packal.org/workflow/github-command-bar) - Lots of helpful commands to find open issues, repos, etc, on the githubs
